# Project-3

This for this applicaton I decided to do a deep-dive into data concerning NBA drafts, salaries, and colleges. 
We used two data sets: NBA Player Salaries - https://data.world/datadavis/nba-salaries & NBA Player Stats - https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats. 
We used Google's Geo-coding API to get the coordinates of all the colleges, Python for data manipulation, cleaning and transformation, and used SQL to store our data. 
We used HTML/CSS, Javascript, D3, Leaflet, and Plotly to create dynamic and interactive data visualizations. 

For this to fully work, we suggest using your own API KEY, as we've placed our config.js in a git ignore.
