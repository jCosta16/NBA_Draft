# NBA Draft and Salaries Dashboard

For this applicaton I decided to do a deep-dive into data concerning NBA drafts, salaries, and colleges. 
Combining two data sets, [NBA Player Salaries](https://data.world/datadavis/nba-salaries) & [NBA Player Stats](https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats), I was abble to create a unified dataset to work with.

Using Google's Geo-coding API to get the coordinates of all the colleges, Python for data manipulation, cleaning and transformation, and used SQL to store our data. 

To deploy the application HTML/CSS, Javascript, D3, Leaflet, and Plotly where used to create dynamic and interactive data visualizations. 

For this to fully work, I ask you to use your own API KEY, since I uploaded my config.js in a git ignore.
