# NBA Draft and Salaries Dashboard

This applicaton is a deep-dive into data concerning NBA drafts, salaries, and colleges. 
Combining two data sets, [NBA Player Salaries](https://data.world/datadavis/nba-salaries) & [NBA Player Stats](https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats), I was able to create a unified dataset to work with.

Using Google's Geo-coding API to get the coordinates of all the colleges, Python for data manipulation, cleaning and transformation, and SQL to store our data. 

HTML/CSS, Javascript, D3, Leaflet, and Plotly were used to create dynamic and interactive data visualizations. 

For the application to fully work, I kindly request that you use your own Mapbox API KEY for the file [config.js](NBA_Draft_Dashboard/Basketball-dashboard/static/js/config.js), since I omited mine.
